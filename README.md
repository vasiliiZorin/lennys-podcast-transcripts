```

## Episode Format

Each episode has its own folder named after the guest(s), containing a `transcript.md` file with:

1. **YAML Frontmatter** - Structured metadata including:
   - `guest`: Name of the guest(s)
   - `title`: Full episode title
   - `youtube_url`: Link to the YouTube video
   - `video_id`: YouTube video ID
   - `publish_date`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - `description`: Episode description
   - `duration_seconds`: Episode length in seconds
   - `duration`: Human-readable duration
   - `view_count`: Number of views at time of archival
   - `channel`: Channel name

2. **Transcript Content** - Full text transcript of the episode

## Topic Index

The `index/` folder contains AI-generated keyword tags for each episode, organized by topic:

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Product Management](index/product-management.md) | 57+ episodes on PM skills and practices |
| [Leadership](index/leadership.md) | Episodes on management and leadership |
| [Growth Strategy](index/growth-strategy.md) | Growth tactics and frameworks |
| [Product-Market Fit](index/product-market-fit.md) | Finding and measuring PMF |

See [index/README.md](index/README.md) for the complete list of 50 topics.

## Rebuilding the Index

The index is generated using Claude CLI. To regenerate:

```bash
./scripts/build-index.sh
```

This processes transcripts through Claude to generate keyword tags. The script is idempotent - it skips episodes already present in keyword files, so it can be run multiple times safely.

## Usage with AI

### Loading Transcripts

Each transcript is a standalone markdown file that can be easily parsed by AI systems. The YAML frontmatter provides structured metadata that can be extracted programmatically.

### Example: Reading a Transcript

```python
import yaml

def read_transcript(filepath):
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Split frontmatter and content
    parts = content.split('---')
    if len(parts) >= 3:
        frontmatter = yaml.safe_load(parts[1])
        transcript = '---'.join(parts[2:])
        return frontmatter, transcript
    return None, content

# Example usage
metadata, transcript = read_transcript('episodes/brian-chesky/transcript.md')
print(f"Guest: {metadata['guest']}")
print(f"Title: {metadata['title']}")
```
