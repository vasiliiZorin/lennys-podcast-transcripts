# Strategies to Get Buy-in from Skeptical Stakeholders

**Practical tactics from Lenny's Podcast for convincing stakeholders who don't see value in your product or idea.**

*Synthesized from 300+ episodes featuring leaders from Amazon, Stripe, Snap, and more.*

---

## The Core Problem

Stakeholders often reject ideas not because they're bad, but because:
- They weren't sold on the "why" before hearing the "how"
- They need to justify the decision to their own bosses
- They haven't seen proof it can work
- The risk feels higher than the reward

The strategies below address each of these barriers.

---

## Strategy 1: Sell the "Why" Before the "How"

> "A common mistake is overestimating the amount of buy-in you have. People jump straight into logistics when the audience hasn't decided if they even want to do the thing."
>
> — **Wes Kao**

### The Problem
Most pitches fail in the first 30 seconds because they dive into details (timelines, features, process) before establishing why anyone should care.

### The Tactic
Lead with 30-60 seconds of "why this matters" before any details:
- Why we're doing this
- What problem it solves
- What's at stake if we don't act
- What you need from them

### Example
**Bad:** "I want to walk you through the new feature spec. On slide 1, you'll see the user flow..."

**Good:** "We're losing 15% of signups at the onboarding step. I've identified the friction points and have a fix that should recover half of those users. I need 20 minutes to walk you through the solution and get your sign-off to prioritize it."

---

## Strategy 2: Address the Most Obvious Objection (MOO) Upfront

> "If you thought for even two minutes about obvious objections you're likely to get, you often immediately come up with what they are."
>
> — **Wes Kao**

### The Problem
Presenters are "surprised" by objections that were entirely predictable. This makes them look unprepared and undermines credibility.

### The Tactic
Before any pitch, spend 2 minutes listing likely objections. Address them proactively in your presentation—don't wait for someone to raise them.

### Example
If pitching a new market expansion:
- **Obvious objection:** "Our sales team doesn't know how to sell to that segment"
- **Proactive address:** "You might be wondering how we'd sell to this segment given our current team's experience. Here's my proposal for that..."

## Strategy 3: Start Small and Demonstrate Value Fast

> "If people are not quite sold on it, start with one function. Figure out where the burning issue is. Demonstrate that value."
>
> — **Melissa Perri**

### The Problem
Big asks get rejected. Stakeholders don't want to bet on unproven ideas.

### The Tactic
- Don't ask for full investment upfront
- Find one painful problem you can solve quickly
- Deliver visible results
- Use momentum to expand scope

### Framework
| Instead of... | Ask for... |
|---------------|------------|
| Full product buildout | 90-day pilot |
| New team | 1 dedicated person |
| Company-wide rollout | 5 target customers |
| Permanent commitment | Time-boxed experiment with kill criteria |

---

## Strategy 4: Run Experiments to Build Evidence

> "It's very easy to increase revenue with theatrics, but it hurts user experience. We've done the experiments to show that."
>
> — **Ronny Kohavi**

### The Problem
Opinions don't convince skeptics. Data does.

### The Tactic
- Run small A/B tests or pilots before asking for big investments
- Share both wins AND failures (builds credibility)
- Set expectations: 92% of experiments fail, but learnings compound
- Use guardrail metrics to show you're not sacrificing long-term value

### Key Insight
> "At Airbnb, 250 experiments in search relevance led to 6% revenue improvement."

Small, iterative proof beats big promises.

---

## Strategy 5: Create Internal Virality

> "If you share something interesting, it goes viral inside the company. Eventually you hear from VPs saying 'Everyone's talking about this. Why am I the last to hear about it?'"
>
> — **Gaurav Misra (Snap)**

### The Problem
Top-down pitches feel like requests. Bottom-up enthusiasm feels like demand.

### The Tactic
- Build tangible prototypes people can touch
- Share them widely within the company
- Let enthusiasm build organically
- Walk into the executive meeting with momentum already behind you

### Example
At Snap, the design engineering team created prototype products and shared builds internally. By the time leadership heard about it, everyone was already excited.

---

## Strategy 6: Frame as a Movement, Not a Feature

> "Don't pitch as problem-solution. Pitch as 'the world is changing from old game to new game—are you in or out?'"
>
> — **Andy Raskin**

### The Problem
"Problem-solution" pitches position you as a salesperson. Stakeholders resist being sold to.

### The Tactic
Reframe your proposal as part of a larger market shift:
- **Old game:** How things used to work
- **New game:** How the world is changing
- **Your position:** How to win in the new world

### Examples
| Company | Old Game | New Game |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Salesforce | On-premise software | Cloud is the future |
| Gong | Opinions about sales calls | Reality through data |
| HubSpot | Outbound marketing | Inbound marketing |

This makes stakeholders feel they're missing an opportunity, not being sold a feature.

## Strategy 7: Help Stakeholders Make THEIR Case

> "There's a secondary job the champion has: how do I make a decision without getting fired? We have to help them accomplish that job."
>
> — **April Dunford**

### The Problem
Even if a stakeholder likes your idea, they need to justify it to others. If you don't arm them, they can't advocate for you.

### The Tactic
Provide stakeholders with:
- Data and evidence they can cite
- Talking points for their own meetings
- Risk mitigation they can point to
- Language that makes them look thoughtful

### Example
Instead of: "Here's why this is a good idea"

Try: "Here's a one-pager you can share with the board. It covers the opportunity, the risks, and our kill criteria if it doesn't work."

---

## Strategy 8: Write the Press Release First (Working Backwards)

> "Three key paragraphs: who's the customer, what's their problem, what's the solution. It's very hard to do that well."
>
> — **Bill Carr (Amazon)**

### The Problem
Vague proposals get vague responses. Clarity forces commitment.

### The Tactic
Write a mock "press release" dated 12 months from now announcing the success of your initiative. Include:
- Who the customer is
- What problem was solved
- What the outcome was
- A quote from a happy customer

### Why It Works
- Forces you to clarify your thinking
- Makes the vision tangible
- Becomes an alignment tool in reviews
- Exposes weak logic before you invest

---

## Strategy 9: Come with Recommendations, Not Just Questions

> "Say 'Here's what I think we should do. How does that sound? Where do you see gaps?' It reduces cognitive load on your stakeholder."
>
> — **Wes Kao**

### The Problem
Asking "What should I do?" puts the burden on the stakeholder. They're busy. They'll defer or dismiss.

### The Tactic
Always bring a point of view:
- "I recommend X because of Y. Does that align with your thinking?"
- "I see three options. I recommend option B because... What am I missing?"

### Key Insight
Managing up becomes MORE important as you get senior, not less. Leaders respect people who've done the thinking.

---

## Strategy 10: Lead with Listening

> "You really have to come in with that beginner's mindset. Listen. Don't jump in with ideas necessarily. Take time to understand."
>
> — **Shweta Shrivastava**

### The Problem
Pitching before understanding the stakeholder's real concerns leads to talking past each other.

### The Tactic
Before pitching, ask:
- What's your biggest concern about this area?
- What would need to be true for you to support this?
- What have you seen work or fail in similar situations?

Their objection often reveals the real problem to solve—which might be different from what you assumed.

## Quick Reference: The Buy-in Playbook

| Situation | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Stakeholder says "not a priority" | Reframe as movement they'll miss (Strategy 6) |
| Stakeholder wants proof | Run small experiment, share data (Strategy 4) |
| Stakeholder is skeptical of you | Start small, deliver, build trust (Strategy 3) |
| Stakeholder has their own boss to convince | Give them the talking points (Strategy 7) |
| Stakeholder objects immediately | You didn't sell the "why" first (Strategy 1) |
| Stakeholder seems disengaged | Make a prototype they can touch (Strategy 5) |
| Stakeholder asks "what do you think?" | Come with a recommendation (Strategy 9) |
| Stakeholder's objection surprises you | You didn't do MOO prep (Strategy 2) |

---

## The Meta-Strategy

Before any stakeholder conversation, answer these questions:

1. **Why should they care?** (Lead with this)
2. **What will they object to?** (Address it proactively)
3. **What's the smallest ask that proves the concept?** (Start here)
4. **What do they need to tell their boss?** (Arm them)
5. **What does success look like in 90 days?** (Make it concrete)
