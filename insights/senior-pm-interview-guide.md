**20 questions to ask (or prepare for), what skills they test, and what to demonstrate.**

*Synthesized from Lenny's Podcast episodes with leaders from Amazon, Google, Stripe, Uber, Meta, and more.*

---

## Category 1: Impact & Results

### 1. "Tell me about a project you're most proud of."

**Skills tested:** Judgment, taste, intrinsic motivation, ability to define success

**What great looks like:** They pick something with real business impact, explain WHY it mattered (not just what shipped), and show genuine passion.

> "Use the PEARL framework to evaluate: Problem (big enough?), Epiphany (unique insight?), Action (hard work?), Result (outcome?), Learning (growth?)"
>
> — **Jackie Bavaro**, Asana

### 2. "Walk me through a product you shipped that failed. What happened?"

**Skills tested:** Self-awareness, learning orientation, intellectual honesty

**What great looks like:** They own the failure without blame-shifting, extract specific lessons, and show how they applied those lessons later.

### 3. "What's the biggest impact you've had on a business metric? How do you know it was you?"

**Skills tested:** Data fluency, attribution thinking, business acumen

## Category 2: Strategic Thinking

**Skills tested:** Structured thinking, identifying the "eigenquestion" (the fundamental question that unlocks everything)

**What great looks like:** They don't jump to tactics. They ask: "What's the one question that, if answered, determines the strategy?" (e.g., "Is this safe?" changes everything)

> "This tests whether they can find the eigenquestion—the question that, when answered, makes all other questions easier."
>

### 5. "How would you evaluate whether we should enter [adjacent market]?"

**Skills tested:** Market analysis, strategic frameworks, business judgment

| Blames others for failures | Won't own problems |
| Solutions take months to test | Doesn't think about speed to signal |
| Talks process, not outcomes | Confuses activity with results |
| No contrarian views | May just follow consensus |
| Can't explain trade-offs | Oversimplifies decisions |
| Engineers wouldn't endorse them | Likely not adding value to teams |

## The PEARL Framework for Behavioral Answers

When answering "Tell me about a time..." questions, structure your response:

| Element | What to Cover |
|---------|---------------|
| **P**roblem | Was it big enough to matter? |
| **E**piphany | What insight did you have that others didn't? |
| **A**ction | What did you actually do? Was it hard? |
| **R**esult | What were the outcomes? |
| **L**earning | How did you grow from this? |

## Bonus: Great Reference Check Question

When checking references on PM candidates:

> "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?"
>
> — **Paul Adams**, Intercom

This question can't be dodged and surfaces real developmental areas.
