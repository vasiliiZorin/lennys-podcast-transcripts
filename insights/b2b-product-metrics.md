# Key Metrics for B2B Products

**Essential metrics and benchmarks for B2B SaaS products, from Lenny's Podcast.**

*Synthesized from episodes with Jason Lemkin (SaaStr), Todd Jackson (First Round), Elena Verna (Amplitude, Miro), Patrick Campbell (ProfitWell), and others.*

## Revenue Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Benchmarks |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **ARR/MRR** | Annual/Monthly Recurring Revenue | $10M ARR before first salesperson (Notion) is exceptional |
| **NRR (Net Revenue Retention)** | Revenue kept + expansion from existing customers | 100% minimum, 110%+ strong, 142-180% elite (Snowflake) |
| **Expansion Revenue** | Upsells/cross-sells to existing customers | Should eventually equal or exceed new revenue |
| **ACV (Average Contract Value)** | Average deal size | $75K+ at 100 customers = strong for enterprise |

---

## Churn & Retention

| Metric | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|
| **Monthly churn (SMB)** | 3-4% is "almost unsolvable"—avoid this segment |
| **Annual regretted churn** | <10% for strong PMF, 10-20% acceptable early stage |
| **Logo churn vs Revenue churn** | Track both—losing small customers is different from losing big ones |

> "Nothing matters in B2B if it doesn't compound. Dark patterns anti-compound."
>
> — **Jason Lemkin**, SaaStr

## Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Burn Multiple** | Burn / New ARR | 1-3x (strong PMF), <5x (developing) |
| **Magic Number** | New ARR / Sales & Marketing Spend | 0.5-0.75 (developing), >1.0 (efficient) |
| **CAC Payback** | Months to recover acquisition cost | <12 months ideal |
| **Gross Margin** | (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue | >60-70% for SaaS |

---

## Product-Led Growth Metrics

| Metric | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|
| **Freemium → Paid conversion** | ~5% |
| **Trial → Paid conversion** | 10-15% |
| **Activation rate** | 5-15% (stricter definition = better long-term retention) |
| **PQL (Product Qualified Lead)** | Users showing buying signals |
| **PQA (Product Qualified Account)** | Multiple users in org = enterprise opportunity |

### PQL vs PQA

> "PQL is an individual user showing buying intent. PQA is multiple users in an organization showing enterprise potential. Track PQAs / Engaged ICP teams as your conversion rate."
>
> — **Elena Verna**

---

## Sales Metrics

| Metric | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|
| **First call → Close (no warm intro)** | ~10% (developing PMF) |
| **Close rate with qualification** | 75% (Looker's "forward deploy" process) |
| **Sales cycle** | $20-30K deals: weeks; $100-200K deals: 3-6 months |
| **Inbound from referrals** | 10%+ = word of mouth working |

### The Danger Zone

Worst quadrant: **Slow sales cycle + low ACV**. Either speed up the cycle or increase deal size.

## Todd Jackson's PMF Levels Framework

A practical framework for knowing where you are and what metrics matter:

### Level 1: Finding PMF (0-5 customers)

| Attribute | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Revenue | Pre-seed stage |
| Team | Founders only |
| Focus | 5 genuinely satisfied customers |
| Metrics | Qualitative only |

### Level 2: Developing PMF (5-25 customers)

| Attribute | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Revenue | $500K - $5M ARR |
| Team | Up to 20 people |
| Sales conversion | ~10% without warm intro |
| Magic number | 0.5 - 0.75 |
| Regretted churn | 10-20% acceptable |
| NRR | At least 100% |
| Gross margin | Not worse than 50% |
| Burn multiple | Not worse than 5x |

### Level 3: Strong PMF (25-100 customers)

| Attribute | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Revenue | $5M - $25M ARR |
| Team | 30-100 people |
| Referral inbound | 10%+ from word of mouth |
| Regretted churn | Less than 10% |
| NRR | Greater than 110% |
| Gross margin | Above 60-70% |
| Burn multiple | 1-3x, ideally close to 1x |

## Pricing & Value Metrics

### The Value Metric

The unit you charge on (seats, usage, API calls, etc.) is the most important pricing decision.

> "Most important pricing decision pound-for-pound. Churn is 20-25% lower because customers downgrade instead of cancel. Expansion revenue typically doubles."
>
> — **Patrick Campbell**, ProfitWell

### Pricing Insights

| Insight | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Value-based pricing | 20-25% lower churn |
| Tactical retention fixes | Solves 25-40% of churn in ~2 months |
| Annual price increases | Only if NPS >20 and you've added 30%+ value |

### Strategic vs Tactical Retention

| Type | What It Covers | % of Churn |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **Strategic** | Product features, roadmap, time to value | 60-75% |
| **Tactical** | Payment failures, term optimization, cancellation flows | 25-40% |

> "Tactical retention: 2 months of work can solve 25-40% of your churn problem."
>
> — **Patrick Campbell**

## Leading Indicators to Watch

| Leading Indicator | Why It Matters |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Activation rate** | Predicts retention months later |
| **Time to value** | Faster = higher conversion |
| **Usage depth** | Multiple features used = stickier |
| **Multi-user adoption** | Teams > individuals for enterprise |
| **Support tickets** | Often signals confusion, not satisfaction |

---

## Growth Loop Timelines

> "New growth loops take 6-18 months to show visible revenue. You need a new major channel/loop every 5 years. Test new loops every 18 months (most will fail). Allocate 20-25% of growth team time annually to new loops."
>
> — **Elena Verna**

---

## The Metrics That Matter Most by Stage

| Stage | Focus On |
|-------|----------|
| **Pre-PMF** | Qualitative: Are 5 customers genuinely happy? |
| **Early traction** | Activation, first-call conversion, churn |
| **Scaling** | NRR, burn multiple, magic number |
| **Growth** | CAC payback, expansion revenue, referral % |

---

## Trial & Conversion Insights

| Insight | Source |
|---------|--------|
| 14-day trials came from Salesforce sales wanting to close same month—not customer-centric | Jason Lemkin |
| Slack, Zoom, Canva: Infinite trials worked well | Jason Lemkin |
| Don't force annual contracts for SMB—let customers pay how they want | Jason Lemkin |
| Optimal cancellation flow: 18-30 seconds, 2 questions | Patrick Campbell |

## NRR Benchmarks by Company

| Company | NRR | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Snowflake | 142-180% | Elite, usage-based pricing |
| Best-in-class SaaS | 120-140% | Strong expansion motion |
| Good | 110-120% | Healthy business |
| Minimum viable | 100% | Not shrinking, but not growing from base |
| Concerning | <100% | Revenue leaking |
